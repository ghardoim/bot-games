### sudoku

Since I couldn't find any clean sudoku games online, I created my own.
Of course I copied and pasted almost everything related to the web (HTML, CSS, JS) and only made a few minor changes.
The main goal of this project is to create a bot, with Python, to solve this.

### crossword

Find, click, drag and drop. Just verify if the word is in one of both direction for each board row, column and diagonals.
